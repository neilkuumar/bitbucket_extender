# bitbucket_extender
Chrome Extension to add functionality to your Bitbucket PRs!

Something I really quickly hacked together to add a nice Copy Branch Name button to our self hosted bitbucket instance.

Replace "HOST_NAME" in `manifest.json` with your actual host.

I will create an environment variable at some point!
