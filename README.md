# bitbucket_extender
Chrome Extension to add functionality to your Bitbucket PRs!

Something I really quickly hacked together to add a nice Copy Branch Name button to our self hosted bitbucket instance.

1. Replace "HOST_NAME" in `manifest.json` with your actual host. I will create an environment variable at some point!
2. Go to chrome://extensions/, click `load unpacked` and import this folder
