# bitbucket_extender
Chrome Extension to add functionality to your Bitbucket PRs!

Something I really quickly hacked together to add a nice Copy Branch Name button to our self hosted bitbucket instance.

There's quite a few places you need to replace "HOST_NAME" with your actual host.

For now just find and replace on the entire repo, I will create an environment variable at some point!
